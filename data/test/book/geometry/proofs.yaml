- theorem: "symmetric property of congruent segments"
  given: "line segment PQ is congruent to line segment XY"
  prove: "line segment XY is congruent to line segment PQ"
  statements: [ "line segment PQ is congruent to line segment XY",
                "length of line segment PQ is equal to the length of line segment XY",
                "length of line segment XY is equal to the length of line segment PQ",
                "line segment XY is congruent to line segment PQ",
  ]
  reasons: [ "given",
             "congruent segments",
             "symmetric property of equality",
             "congruent segments",
  ]
